# myos

## Description
**myos** is a simple OS that runs on a Raspberry Pi 3B+ (3B should work too). I created it because I wanted to learn more about operating systems and low-level programming. I test it on my Raspberry Pi and also in QEMU.

## Status
- Newest feature is processes + context switching
- libc implementation is a work in progress
